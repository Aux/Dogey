[![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/158057120493862912/widget.png)](https://discord.gg/B4BwQ8r)  

Dogey is a bot (for [Discord](https://discordapp.com) duh) built for use in multiple guilds but not tested on a large scale. It also serves as the guinea pig for new ideas I might want to do test implementations of. Currently undergoing it's 27th rewrite, I'm adding features constantly as the motivation arises.

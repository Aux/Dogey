Dogey is a combination between an example of different database providers inside of a discord bot, and also my personal do-whatever bot. If I feel like having a bot do something that doesn't quite belong in [Doggo](https://github.com/Doggo), I'll add it here and do my best to mirror it across all providers where relevant.

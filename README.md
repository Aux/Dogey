## Dogey  
[![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/158057120493862912/widget.png)](https://discord.gg/B4BwQ8r)  

Dogey is a bot [Discord](https://discordapp.com) built for managing a few servers I have set up. It also serves as a testing grounds for any good or bad ideas I might conjure up and feel like writing out a quick implementation. Currently undergoing it's 27th rewrite, I'm adding features as consistently as the motivation arises. [Click on this link right here to join my guild](https://discord.gg/B4BwQ8r).
